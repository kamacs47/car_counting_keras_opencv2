With development it is not often observed clear comfort for the men, but it creates one more hurdles which have to solve. So same goes for the automobiles and traffic, vehicles were invented in first place to solve the problem face by the mankind, but it has created a some kind chain reaction that has trigger other problem which is traffic created by it.Off course human population is one among the reason for increase in the number of the cars. But anyway the problem have to be solved in one or other way. So in this project we have try to solve the traffic management using  'deep learning'. 
so in the project we have deploy Convolutional neural network that could    classify the vehicle both moving and stationary. And it classify the moving vehicle and count the numbers of vehicle crossing a particular roads at particular time. Now using the data gather by the system we could deploy an algorithm to control the traffic signal rather than conventional way of traffic control.
